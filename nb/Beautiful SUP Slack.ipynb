Best used when activity that would incite posting a message occurs in a remote service.\\n\\nExample: If you have an issue tracking system and want to post to a channel when a bug is created or resolved, use an incoming webhook invoked from your issue tracking system.\\n\\n\\nSlash commands - members execute slash commands from within Slack, resulting in us triggering your server to return them a  message. The message can either be displayed only to the executing user, or to the channel from which it was triggered.\\n\\nExample: Your slash command allows users to create and resolve bugs from the Slack command line with either action resulting in a message being displayed to that channel.\\n\\n\\nBot users - Your service monitors channels and direct messages for certain conversational triggers, like specific text in messages posted or emoji responses. As appropriate, your bot user posts messages or performs tasks inside or outside of Slack on a team's behalf.\\n\\nExample: Your bot monitors a channel's messages for specific issue IDs and sends the channel a message containing details about them.\\nExample: Your bot tracks a team's emoji reactions and sends a message at the end of the day to celebrate those most used.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \n",

Here are some tips in the unfortunate event you're having trouble and need to determine exactly how broken Slack might be.\\n\\nWhen possible, we report on current status promptly through these channels:\\n\\n\\nCheck status.slack.com for any service disruption advisories.\\nFollow @SlackStatus on Twitter for real time updates on system health.\\n\\n\\nTry these tips to further divine service health when these resources aren't convincing:\\n\\n\\nSend a simple HTTP GET to the https://slack.com/api/api.test API method. A HTTP 200 application/json response of {\"ok\":true} indicates at least part of the Slack Web API is available.\\nSend a more complex, authenticated request to https://slack.com/api/auth.test using a bot, user, or legacy token. Using this method exercises the authorization and API layer further than api.test and may grant you the serenity of greater confidence in Slack availability.\\nDo you use RTM? Slack does. Try using rtm.connect to generate a websocket URL using a token with the proper permissions, then open the socket using a tool like this simple browser-based websocket client for Google Chrome.\\n\\n\\nStill unsure if Slack is down?

Other tokens you obtain by sending users through the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.\\n\\nWhen you're working with Slack apps, you'll be awarded access tokens after a user approves your application.\\n\\nYou can also obtain workspace-specific test tokens for use with the Web API using our token generator, but they should not be shared with the public or other workspaces.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy private URL\\n\\nYour incoming webhooks URLs are unique for your integration or application and do not require token-based authentication. Slash command response URLs also already encode your integration or application's identity.\\n\\nWebhook URLs generated by rtm.start also encode the information you need to connect, though requesting rtm.start itself requires a token as described above.\\n\\n  \n",

This means that the URL we're trying to reach must be accessible to Slack's servers.\\n\\nTo determine whether your certificate is valid, consider using this tool provided by SSL Labs.\\n\\n  \n",

Rate limits are currently unpublished. Review our rate limiting documentation for more detail.\\n\\nThe guiding spirit of Slack's rate limiting is to ensure that teams are able to communicate effortlessly and without distraction.\\n\\nBecause the limits are unpublished, you won't know that you're about to hit a rate limit in advance. You will receive a HTTP 429 Too Many Requests rate limited message in response to a request and will then need to wait for the next rate limiting window to open.\\n\\nThe next rate limit is indicated by a HTTP header called Retry-After, presented in seconds to wait before attempting another request. If the value were 10, then you should wait 10 seconds or more before retrying that request.\\n\\nYou may find that you can't perform certain bursty actions, like attempting to message every member of a large workspace simultaneously. In some cases, hitting rate limits may be a symptom that there are better ways to to accomplish your goal. Some times you just need to work slower.\\n\\nBot users associated with many workspaces may hit rate limits while using rtm.start too quickly. Queue up your connection requests or throttle otherwise after your service restarts.\\n\\nFinally, developers working with the Real Time Messaging API have special considerations worth reading in context.\\n\\nFor more information, consult our rate limiting documentation.\\n\\n  \n",

There's a blog post discussing this change of behavior.\\n\\nFile objects contain url_private and url_private_download fields, as well as fields for private thumbnail URLs as applicable.\\n\\nTo retrieve these URLs, you must provide a HTTP Authentication header containing a bearer token that's been awarded the files:read or read scopes.\\n\\nFor example, to retrieve a thumb_360 field containing https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/Z0CHK-THSCH5-5SZ0UT/cheese.jpg and your bearer token was VALID_TOKEN, you'd need to send a request like this:\\n\\nGET https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/Z0CHK-THSCH5-5SZ0UT/cheese.jpg\\nAuthorization: VALID_TOKEN\\n\\n\\n  \n",

While the connection is open, you'll be streamed events associated with the workspace you're connecting on behalf of and can in turn send messages.\\n\\nTypical HTTP client libraries and tools do not support connecting to websockets directly.

Subscribe to other events your bot may be interested in.\\nInstall your Slack app to your workspace through app management to activate subscriptions and receive your bot user token.\\nUse the bot user token to send messages to chat.postMessage to post new messages or reply to users.\\n\\n\\nThe RTM API may be used instead of the Events API to receive messages (and many more events) over a websocket. Simple messages can also be sent via the RTM API without needing to use chat.postMessage.\\n\\nTo build a bot that will stand the test of time, consider the upcoming workspace token model.\\n\\nSee these open source CLI apps for inspiration.\\n\\n  \n",

Use the Web API to post messages and perform channel operations. The XMPP or IRC part of the gateway is its own adventure to explore.\\n\\nChoose the token type that works best for you. Bot user tokens work well if your user is a bot but poorly if your user is you. Legacy testing tokens may work in a pinch, but properly scoped user tokens work best, as they model your own relationship to Slack. The client scope is useful but overly broad and not suitable for an app distributed on the App Directory.\\n\\nUsing your user token to post as yourself when posting messages with chat.postMessage is best.\\n\\nApps operating as a gateway should never distribute their API keys, secrets, or tokens.\\n\\nConsult these open source CLI apps for some inspiration.
