In Mongolia, we don\\x92t have elementary school, secondary school, or high school divided into three parts, but we have from 1st grade until 12th grade in one school so we don\\x92t really call them like high school or secondary school or elementary school. And for the high school, like, from the 8th grade until 12th grade, well, they study what other students study in different countries but nowadays they are focusing on more, like, English studies or different language studies. \\nTodd: How long is a typical class? Do you have, let\\x92s say, six classes a day, each class is one hour? \\nHeidi: We start school at 8:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the [after] noon and we have about six classes a day. Each class has like 45 minutes. So we finish at 1:00. \\nTodd: And then, what do you do in the afternoon? \\nHeidi: We go back.\\nTodd: You go home?\\nHeidi: Yes, \\x91cause in Mongolia we have two parts. In the morning, the high school students go to the school and from 1:30 the elementary school students go to the school so we share one class [between] two classes. \\nTodd: Oh, so you split the school?\\nHeidi: Yes. \\nTodd: So do teachers sometimes have to teach both levels? \\nHeidi: Yes.\\nTodd: Wow! That\\x92s tough. \\nHeidi: Yeah.\\nTodd: So when you go home, do you usually...do have family there waiting or do usually both parents work?\\nHeidi: In Mongolia, the mother and father they usually work and when I finish my school I just go back and make my own food, because in Mongolia mothers\\x92 work is not to, like, stay at home or do housework. Kids are taught to clean up the home and cook their food and wash their clothes and that\\x92s your work and usually the mothers don\\x92t do that kind of thing. \\nTodd: Oh, so the children have to do all that work?\\nHeidi: Yes.\\nTodd: Actually it\\x92s quite similar I think in the US pretty much. So what about your study load? Do you have a really heavy study load? Like, do you have two hours of homework a night or...?\\nHeidi: It really depends on the school but for me, like, I was studying in an international school so I had to study quite hard to get the level still. So for me, I studied after school...I\\x92d rather study at night, so I studied like 3 or 4 hours at night. So that\\x92s my study habit. \\nTodd: That\\x92s a lot. \\nHeidi: Not really compared to other students. \\n\\ntypical \\nHow long is a typical class?\\nTypical means \\x93normal\\x94 or \\x93average\\x94. If something is surprising or unusual then it would not be typical. Notice the following examples:\\nlet\\x92s say\\nDo you have, let\\x92s say, six classes a day?\\nLet\\x92s say is an informal way to say \\x93for example\\x94 or \\x93let\\x92s imagine\\x94. Sometimes people also shorten \\x93let\\x92s say\\x94 to just \\x93say\\x94. Here are some sample sentences:\\nsplit\\nSo you split the school?\\nWhen you spilt something you \\x93divide\\x94 it into two parts. Look at the following examples:\\nstudy load\\nYou have a heavy study load.\\nA study load is the amount of classes or courses a student has to study. If a student has many difficult classes, then they have a heavy study load. If they have an easy schedule at school, then they have a light study load. Notice the following:\\nstudy habit\\nThat's my study habit.\\nA habit is something one does again and again often without thinking. Therefore, a study habit is one's habit about studying. A student with good study habits probably studies the same about of time every day. A student with poor study habits probably only studies at the last minute before tests or assignments.

In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal \\nTodd: Wow, that sounds pretty good.\\nAlexandra:  Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go.\\nTodd: Alright, thanks.

It's quite simple really, you just say that you noticed the watch boxes had been tampered with when you accepted the delivery from the suppliers. That'll take the heat off us and move the investigation onto them. \\n\\n\\nTim:\\n\\n Yeah, but the police won't just take my word for it, will they? \\n\\n\\nBoss:\\n\\n That's true Tim, they probably won't, but I'm going to arrange for them to find some more evidence to link the fake watches firmly to the supplier and not us. I won't go into details, but it'll work, trust me.  \\n\\n\\nTim:\\n\\n So somebody else will end up being charged with a crime they didn't commit.  \\n\\n\\nBoss:\\n\\n Well if it isn't somebody else Tim, it'll probably be you. \\n\\n\\nTim:\\n\\n Can I just say something here?\\n\\n\\nBoss:\\n\\n Yes Tim, what is it?\\n\", \"Episode 17: Booking tickets*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Agent:\\n Good morning, London Attractions.\\n\\n\\n Michal:\\n I'd like to book two tickets for next week.
